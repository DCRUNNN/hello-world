Some people may ask, since E-books have become more and more popular in the modern society, do we still need libraries that seem to be less necessary? If you like, you can go to a university library and take a walk around the corner where no one is there. Trust me, the pleasure that accidentally discovering a good book you need in the dusty place, the surprise of noticing that your familiar name appearing in the borrower's column, are (is??) the most wonderful gift from the library which emits ink (//FIXME)
Now, I would like（let me？？） to lead you into the library of the Sanjiang University, the most energetic place on campus.
Founded in 1993, Sanjiang University Library,which occupies an existing building area of around 21000 square meters, was officially opened in September 2009 with wireless network covering the entire building. The library currently has 3903 seats for reading, including 422 seats for electronic reading (search seats included). There are 1.33 million paper books and over 2 million e-books resources(含包库？？) collected in the library. What’s more, there are more than 1242 kinds of Chinese and foreign publications stored in the library, and the quantity of non-book materials reaches 39000.
When it comes to the establishment of 最空间（extreme space？）, the entire project, from conception, design to implementation, was all done by the student team and responsible teachers of Sanjiang University.
Located on the fifth floor of the library and covering an area of more than 100 square meters, 最空间 is divided into four different functional areas, which are brainstorming area, design work area, small meeting area and exhibition area.
